This is one of the project that I have completed for my Machine Learning Nanodegree.

## Project: Predicting Boston Housing Prices

Here are some of the required python libraries:
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

You will need [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) to run the ipython notebook.

The `boston_housing.ipynb` is the main notebook file. `visuals.py` Python file are for visualizing the data and the `housing.csv` is the dataset.

The modified Boston housing dataset consists of 489 data points, with each datapoint having 3 features. This dataset is a modified version of the Boston Housing dataset found on the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing).

**Features**
1.  `RM`: average number of rooms per dwelling
2. `LSTAT`: percentage of population considered lower status
3. `PTRATIO`: pupil-teacher ratio by town

**Target Variable**
4. `MEDV`: median value of owner-occupied homes
